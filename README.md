repo for nlp project - Automated natural language headline generation using learning models


Open questions:

1. Evaluation - F1 wont be good idea. Need to find a way to see similarity between two senteces. Whats the best approach here?
a. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17022691/python-semantic-similarity-score-for-strings
b. cosine similarity - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15173225/how-to-calculate-cosine-similarity-given-2-sentence-strings-python
c. http://ants.iis.sinica.edu.tw/3BkMJ9lTeWXTSrrvNoKNFDxRm3zFwRR/55/Sentence%20Similarity%20Based%20on%20Semantic%20Nets%20and%20corpus%20statistics.pdf

Any other?

2. Decide on the models-  which one will we use? 
3.  Read the paper- We might need to use a POS tagger for the case(as given in the paper). And so search a POS tagger for the language. If we cant get one for Hindi, might need to switch language.
